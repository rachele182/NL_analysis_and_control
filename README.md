<font color="green">**Title**:</font> Analysis in terms of controllability and observability of a non-linear system and control with FB linearization and adaptive Backstepping techniques. 

This work is a result of the final project for the Master Course "Robot Control", as part of the Robotics and Automation Master Degree at the *UniversitaÂ´di Pisa*.   
The goal is to analyse structural properties i.e *Controllability* and *Observability* of a non-linear system and use this analysis to design two control techniques for non-linear system e.g *Feedback Dynamic Linearization* and *Adpative Backstepping*.   
The analysis include the aproximated linear system and filtration methos for both controllability and observability.
A process of identificability of friction coefficients is also included.   
In the figure below you can see a schematic rapresentation of a generic rocket, chosen as the use-case-study system.

The simulation files and the control are all written in Matlab/Simulink environment.   
Please refer to the file *contents.md* inside the simulation_files folder for a description of the files and the instructions to run the simultation.
